Rainy is a nice-looking, rain-oriented weather app for iOS, written in Swift. Basically, the ideal tool if you live in a place like Vancouver. Currently available for download [on the iOS App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/fm/app/rainy-rain-forecasts/id1312152536).

Rainy is √ºber-cool because:

- It uses no external libraries! The entire source code + image and font assets package is only 1.2 MB, saving space on your iPhone.
- It is GDPR-compliant! Meaning: it merely performs a single HTTP request to get your weather. No BS, no analytics frameworks, no advertisements, no pinging unknown Chinese ad networks that deliver personalized noodles recommendations. üçú

The app was open-sourced on September 3rd, 2018. More details will follow.
